# 🎨 ShadowCSS Editor

## 📃 Description

*ShadowCSS is a quick, easy to use, css box-shadow generator/editor. It is packed with features and offers quick and easy way to create beautifull shadows for your next project. Complementary to it's editor it also offers guides and presets. It's written in HTML, CSS and JS.*

## 📐 Alpha

*The project is still in alpha. All the major features are implemented, but it might be unstable or uncompatible with some devices.*

## 📌 Try it out
The project is currently hosted on cloudflare network, files are directly pulled from git repo, then modified to include all the necessary api keys and scripts needed in production. You can host the project on any web server. I specifically chose cloudflare because of their amazing free tier, which allows for amazing availibility, latency and security completely for free.

## Challenges I faced during the development
*This was supposed to be a one day project. Very soon I realized that my first time estimates were completely unrealistic. I worked on this project in my free time and it took me around 3-4 months. Many times I had to start over. In the end, I settled with the fifth version of the software, which was good enough to be dragged across the finish line.*


## 📌 Next steps

*I still have some ideas I would like to implement. There are still some less then optimal solutions in the software that I would like to iron out. While i won't rewrite it from scratch again I might publish some updates.*
